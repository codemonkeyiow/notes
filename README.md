> When I was 4 years old, or so my mother tells me, I saw another kid biting his nails. As people have a tendency to do, I mimicked the behaviour. My mom would slap my hand away from my mouth and say "stop biting your nails"!
So for my entire life I continued to bite my nails. At times, when I was particularly stressed they would be little stubs on the end of my fingers. I did make a conscious effort to stop a few times; I bought a bitter nail varnish advertised to assist in the effort, but I got used to it and chomped away.
In February of 2023 I had what most people would describe as a religious experience. I wouldn't call it that, but it was a very powerful event that shifted my mindset on a fundamental level. A week or so after my mind being blown wide open I realised that I had long nails, dirty long nails that I needed to clean. A new experience.
Short of the long, pun intended, I just poked myself in the eye. Picking my nose is painful.
